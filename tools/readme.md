Dev Tools
=========

Each development tool that once was in this directory has been moved to its own
repository. As a result, this is a list of recommended tools (or just tools
that I made -- not really _recommended_, just that they work) for GBA-dev:

1. [Bitmap exporter](https://github.com/jptiz/bitmap-to-code)
   > **Description**
   >
   > Used for exporting bitmap-files to any format given a template --
   > including .cpp and .h sources.

2. [Map editor](https://github.com/jptiz/map-editor)
   > **Description**
   >
   > Used for editing maps and exporting them to any format given a template --
   > including .cpp and .h.
