LibGBA - CPP
============

What is it?
-----------

It's a C++ library for GBA homebrew development. Focused on better API and
abstraction, so programmers can focus more on game logic and call functions for
effects instead of thinking in a too low-level way.

Requirements
------------

A lot of statements are being written with C++11/14/17 features, so, the
requirements are:

- GCC 7.1 or above;
- DevKitPro (to compile for GBA ARMv4 ISA and ARM7TDMI processor).
